When we reach maturity, production of growth factors diminishes. As a result, cell turnover and repair slows, eventually affecting our appearance. This triple-action age-defying treatment is BIOEFFECT’s most potent formula and the first and only skincare product to contain three different types of growth factors that work together in harmony to maximize efficacy: IL-1a (interleukin 1A) increases skin’s elasticity and maintains the skin's barrier function; KGF (Keratinocyte Growth Factor) increases density and visibly diminishes wrinkles and fine lines; and EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) supports the production of collagen and elastin as well as increasing the skin’s capacity to store water. Increased potency means more profound results, making this unparalleled in skincare repair. It maximizes hydration, tone, and radiance while visibly minimizing wrinkles, pore size, and redness. What else you need to know:This treatment contains only nine ingredients; no preservatives or additives. The three small bottles, each containing a 10-day supply, are easy to carry, easy to transport, and easy to apply-morning and night.

Solutions for: - Fine lines and wrinkles - Loss of firmness and elasticity - Dullness and uneven texture If you want to know more…This award-winning, bestselling serum replenishes the body’s own natural supply of EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) and rejuvenates skin cells, thus helping to slow the aging process. From birth until adulthood, our bodies manufacture copious amounts of proteins called growth factors that communicate with cells, sending messages to repair, rejuvenate, and so on. EGF is one of the most important growth factor for skin cells, helping them to boost production of collagen and elastin and increase the skin’s capacity to retain water to maintain healthy, youthful and dense skin. When we reach maturity, production of growth factors diminishes. As a result, cell turnover and repair slows, eventually affecting our appearance. In fact, skin density thins by one percent each year after we turn twenty, and it is further reduced by up to 30 percent during menopause. Skin starts to sag and fine lines and wrinkles appear. There are many factors that play a role in skin aging and some are beyond our control, like genetics. We can, however, lead a healthy lifestyle, protect our skin from the sun, and use effective anti-aging skincare products. What else you need to know: This serum contains only seven ingredients; no preservatives or additives. The bottle may be small but the serum inside is incredibly potent and long-lasting. You only need two to four drops per nighttime use to see visible, lasting results. The barley-based EGF is uniquely pure and grown in an ecologically-engineered greenhouse in Iceland with a negative CO2 footprint. Research results:An independent scientific double-blind split-face study, that included 29 women using Cellular Age-Defying Serum twice, daily for 2 months demonstrated: - 60% increase in skin thickness - 30% increase in skin density

P438639	R45 The Reversal 3-Phase Retinol Booster System	BeautyBio	https://www.sephora.com/product/r45-reversal-3-phase-retinol-booster-system-P438639	150.00	Face Serums	https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2163038-main-grid.jpg	5.0	5	Which skin type is it good for?✔ Normal✔ Oily✔ Combination✔ Dry✔ Sensitive What it is:An award-winning, patented skincare booster system that is clinically proven to repair skin spots, wrinkles, pores, and skin tone unevenness in one 45-day treatment. Solutions for: - Fine lines and wrinkles - Loss of firmness and elasticity - Dullness and uneven texture If you want to know more… In a clinical study using facial skin scan analysis, R45 The Reversal achieved an unprecedented 49.5 percent reduction in the appearance of fine lines and deep mechanical wrinkles after one 45-day treatment. Its patented three-phase booster system breaks through the result plateaus other products encounter, allowing your skin to access concentrations of active ingredients at clinical levels never before possible. Proprietary TriGLO™ retinol regeneration complex and growth factor stimulant (GFS) serum combine during application to work synergistically in skin. Push your skin to achieve visible, lasting results with R45 The Reversal, a system so powerful you only need to use it two to three times a year. Concentrations of the deep-release retinol complex increase from Phase 1 to Phase 2 to Phase 3, allowing even the most sensitive skin to adjust without side effects while awaking skin's sleeping giants with each step-up phase for clinically tested and proven reduction in the appearance of wrinkles, skin tone unevenness, and pore size. This set contains:- 2 x 0.17 oz/ 15 mL Phase 1 - 2 x 0.17 oz/ 15 mL Phase 2 - 2 x 0.17 oz/ 15 mL Phase 3 What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Parabens- Sulfates- Phthalates What else you need to know:Additional features: - Housed in airless containers for maximum performance from the lab to your bathroom. - Your retinol should be yellow. If an over-the-counter retinol claims to have retinol and isn’t yellow, it doesn’t contain enough of this key active to work. Watch how the yellow color of Phase 1 Retinol Regeneration Complex deepens from Phase 1 to Phase 2 to Phase 3. - Do not skip directly to Phase 3. Retinol is cumulative in the skin. Jumping to Phase 3 doesn’t allow each phase of retinol to build in the skin for best long-term results and a touch up treatment will be required. "R45 is our number one selling, award-winning skincare treatment and a total game changer. 10 out of 10 dermatologists use and will recommend retinoic acid (a form of retinol) for wrinkle reduction. The only problem with this active is it’s incredibly harsh on the skin because it was originally developed for acne and only by chance was discovered to have this incredible side effect of wrinkle reduction. I myself couldn’t use prescriptive retinol, but I knew the incredible benefits and set out on a mission. We knew the retinol ingredients that existed weren’t good enough, so we literally created a new molecule and called her TriGLO®. She is the first ever complex to mimic the skin-smoothing benefits of clinical retinol without the harsh side effects. After almost five years of testing and hundreds of revisions later, we have created the first-ever high-performance retinol every skin type can use. I recommend starting to boost at least twice a year after the age of 30 and once a year from 20 to 30. And PS-your retinol should be yellow (it’s almost turmeric yellow in its raw form). If your over the counter retinol isn’t yellow, there probably isn’t enough in there to do much of anything. Watch how Phase 1 is a golden yellow and transitions to a deep yellow in Phase 3. I usually do a boost in spring and one again in the fall before the holidays."-Jamie O’Banion, Founder R45 The Reversal is formulated without mineral oil, silicone, and fragrance.

They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels.
